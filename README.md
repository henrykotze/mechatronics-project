# mechatronics-project

This project was done in my final year of BEng Mechatronic for the module Mechatronics 424. The project entails using the Siemens PLC Simatic S7-1200 CPU 1214C DC/DC/DC (6ES7214-1AE30-0XB0) to interface with the various components of the project. The project requires to use the HMI software InTouch Wonderware to create a user-friendly operating system.
